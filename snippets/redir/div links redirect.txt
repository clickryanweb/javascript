To achieve this functionality using JavaScript, you can iterate through all the links within a specific `div` element with a class `elementor-image-gallery`, and modify each link to open in a new tab when clicked. Here’s how you can do it:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Get all links within the elementor-image-gallery div
    var galleryLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.elementor-image-gallery a');

    // Loop through each link and add target="_blank" attribute
    galleryLinks.forEach(function(link) {
        link.setAttribute('target', '_blank');
    });
});
```

### Explanation:

1. **DOMContentLoaded Event**: The code is wrapped inside an event listener for `DOMContentLoaded`. This ensures that the JavaScript runs after the HTML content is fully loaded, so it can safely manipulate the DOM.

2. **querySelectorAll**: This method is used to select all `<a>` elements (`<a>` represents anchor tags, which are used for links) within elements that have the class `.elementor-image-gallery`.

3. **forEach Loop**: Iterates through each link (`link`) found by `querySelectorAll`.

4. **setAttribute**: Adds the `target="_blank"` attribute to each link. The `target="_blank"` attribute tells the browser to open the link in a new tab.

### Usage:

- **Include JavaScript**: Place this JavaScript code in a `<script>` tag at the end of your HTML document, just before the closing `</body>` tag, or include it in your theme's JavaScript file if you have one dedicated for custom scripts.

- **Elementor Integration**: Since you mentioned `elementor-image-gallery`, ensure that this class is correctly applied to the div containing your image gallery by inspecting the HTML structure in your browser’s developer tools.

### Considerations:

- **Security**: Opening links in new tabs can affect user experience and should be used judiciously.
  
- **Compatibility**: This approach assumes modern JavaScript support. For compatibility with older browsers, consider using a JavaScript library like jQuery or adapting the code for broader compatibility.

By implementing this JavaScript snippet, all links within the specified `div` class (`elementor-image-gallery`) will now open in new tabs when clicked by users.
